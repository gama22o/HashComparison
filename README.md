#CIS4202 - Ethical Hacking 

This code generates 300 binary strings starting from 10000000. Each string is hashed using MD5 and SHA. The hex is then converted into binary. 
The difference between each consecutive hash, the average difference, and the standard deviation is calculated and printed on the screen.
